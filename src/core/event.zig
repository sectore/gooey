//! Event wrapper with capture/bubble phase support
//!
//! Events flow through the element tree in two phases:
//! 1. Capture: root -> target (top-down)
//! 2. Bubble: target -> root (bottom-up)
//!
//! This matches the DOM event model and allows parent elements
//! to intercept events before children see them (capture) or
//! handle events that children didn't consume (bubble).
